# 📊 Students’ Social Media Addiction Dashboard

This project explores how social media addiction impacts students’ mental health, sleep patterns, academic performance, and daily life. Using a real-world survey dataset, we transformed raw data into powerful insights using **Python, MySQL, and Power BI**.

---

## 📁 Dataset Used
- `Students Social Media Addiction.csv` (Later cleaned and saved as `.xlsx`)
- Contains 300+ rows of survey-based data including:
  - Usage hours, addiction scores, mental health indicators
  - Platform preferences, sleep categories, academic impact
  - Demographics like gender, age, country, relationship status

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** | Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Trend Analysis |
| **MySQL** | Schema Design, Querying Patterns & Segmentation |
| **Power BI** | Dashboards & KPI Visualization |

## 📌 Project Phases

### ✅ Phase 1: Data Cleaning (Python)
- Loaded CSV & handled missing values
- Convert feature names to snake case
- Performed type conversions and cleaned string fields
- Created new features like:
  - `sleep_category`, `usage_category` (bucketed columns)

---

### ✅ Phase 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)
- Used grouped averages and visualizations to analyze:
  - Platform usage trends
  - Sleep vs addiction score
  - Mental health distribution
  - Demographic impacts on addiction

---

### ✅ Phase 3: MySQL-Based Analysis
Key patterns & insights extracted:
- Addiction rate by gender, country, and academic level
- Platform-wise usage and addiction distribution
- Relationship between mental health and sleep deprivation
- Conflicts caused due to excessive social media use
- High-risk student segmentation using multiple conditions

---

### ✅ Phase 4: Power BI Reporting

#### 📄 Report 1: General Addiction & Demographic Analysis
- KPI cards: Total students, Avg addiction score, etc.
- Line chart: Sleep Hours X Addicted Score
- Bar & stacked visuals: Affect Of social Media On Academics Of Students
- Slicers: Gender, Country, Sleep Category

#### 📄 Report 2: Behavioral & Impact Analysis
- Platform vs Addiction Score
-  Affect Of social Media On Relationship Of Students
- Daily Usage X Average Mental health Score line charts

#### 📄 Report 3: Detail Report
- Table/Matrix visual for all students
